### Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
Project Overview

This project applies K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups that can support targeted marketing, customer retention, and business decision-making.

The analysis follows a complete data science workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering model development, and interpretation of results.

## Objectives

Segment customers into meaningful groups using unsupervised learning

Understand customer behavior patterns across different segments

Support data-driven marketing and personalization strategies

Demonstrate practical application of K-Means clustering

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-related attributes commonly used for segmentation analysis, such as:

Customer ID

Demographic information

Spending behavior

Purchase-related features

(The dataset is preprocessed before applying clustering to ensure quality and consistency.)

## Methodology
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

Loaded data using Pandas

Handled missing values and duplicates

Scaled numerical features to normalize the data

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed feature distributions

Identified patterns and correlations

Visualized customer behavior using plots

3. Optimal Cluster Selection

Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters

Evaluated clustering performance visually

4. K-Means Clustering

Applied K-Means algorithm to the processed dataset

Assigned cluster labels to customers

Grouped customers into distinct segments

5. Cluster Interpretation

Analyzed characteristics of each customer segment

Identified high-value, medium-value, and low-engagement customer groups

## Key Insights

Customers can be clearly grouped into distinct behavioral segments

Certain clusters represent high-spending and loyal customers

Other clusters highlight price-sensitive or low-engagement customers

Segmentation enables targeted marketing and improved customer experience

Tools and Technologies

## Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Applications

Customer profiling and personalization

Targeted marketing campaigns

Business strategy and customer retention analysis

Foundational use case for machine learning in analytics

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation, highlighting how unsupervised machine learning can uncover hidden patterns in customer data. The insights derived from this analysis can help businesses improve marketing efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and enhance customer engagement.
